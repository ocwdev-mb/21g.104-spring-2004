Course Description
------------------

This is the continuing instruction in listening, spoken, reading, and written Chinese, with particular emphasis on consolidating basic conversational skills and improving reading confidence and depth. Lab work is required. Intermediate Chinese I, II and III form a sequence; the Fall semester subject [21G.103](/courses/21g-103-chinese-iii-regular-fall-2003) is prerequisite for the Spring. Students who have completed the streamlined sequence [21G.107](/courses/21g-107-chinese-i-streamlined-fall-2014) - [21G.108](/courses/21g-108-chinese-ii-streamlined-spring-2015) are not normally eligible for this subject.

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to speak Chinese with some fluency on basic conversational topics, achieve a basic level of reading competence within simplified and traditional characters learned plus common compounds, and be able to write short compositions.

Classes consist of a combination of lecture, drill practice, discussion, reading comprehension practice, listening comprehension practice, situational dialogue practice, and language games.

Factors involved in the Class Grade include being on time and prepared,completing written assignments carefully and on time, and participating enthusiastically in class activities. Other factors may come in to play, e.g. improvement versus deterioration over the course of the semester, and progress relative to starting level.

*   No make-up quizzes unless you have permission from the lecturer beforehand. If you are sick or unable to make to the class due to unexpected situation, you should contact the lecturer.
*   Homework handed in late will be corrected but receive no credit.
*   Attendance in this class is extremely important. If you were absence without any permission from your lecturer, then your final grade would be affected.

Advice on Approaching the Class
-------------------------------

Engaging in a foreign language class shouldn't feel like a chore that you resent having to perform. If it does, you should probably do some serious thinking about why you are enrolled. A foreign language is a discipline to be studied with attention and dedication. It requires a high level of concentration, and a systematic, steady approach. It is in fact a never-ending process, which involves a consistent accumulation of data (vocabulary) to be applied within a complex framework (grammar). As such, learning a foreign language is often frustrating and so it should be dealt with patiently. But the result of understanding of a foreign language provides lifelong satisfaction. If you approach this course by wondering how little work you can do and still get by, or if you approach this class by thinking only about what grade you are getting instead of what you are learning, then you will not succeed. If, however, you approach this class with dedication and a positive attitude, I guarantee that you will be rewarded with the satisfaction that comes from the genuine acquisition of knowledge and skill.
